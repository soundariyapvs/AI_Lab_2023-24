### DATE: 7/09/2025                                                                          
### REGISTER NUMBER : 212222060249
### AIM: 
To write a prolog program to find the answer of query. 
###  Algorithm:
 Step 1: Start the program <br> 
 Step 2: Convert the sentence into First order Logic  <br> 
 Step 3:  Convert the sentence into Horn clause form  <br> 
 Step 4: Add rules and predicates in a program   <br> 
 Step 5:  Pass the query to program. <br> 
 Step 6: Prolog interpreter shows the output and return answer. <br> 
 Step 8:  Stop the program.
### Program:
### Task 1:
Construct the FOL representation for the following sentences <br> 
1.	John likes all kinds of food.  <br> 
2.	Apples are food.  <br> 
3.	Chicken is a food.  <br> 
4.	Sue eats everything Bill eats. <br> 
5.	 Bill eats peanuts  <br> 
   Convert into clause form and Prove that John like Apple by using Prolog. <br> 
### Program:
% --- Knowledge Base ---

% Rule: John likes all kinds of food
likes(john, X) :-
    food(X).

% Facts: foods
food(apple).
food(chicken).

% Rule: Sue eats everything Bill eats
eats(sue, X) :-
    eats(bill, X).

% Fact: Bill eats peanuts
eats(bill, peanuts).

### Task 2:
Consider the following facts and represent them in predicate form: <br>              
1.	Steve likes easy courses. <br> 
2.	Science courses are hard. <br> 
3. All the courses in Have fun department are easy <br> 
4. BK301 is Have fun department course.<br> 
Convert the facts in predicate form to clauses and then prove by resolution: “Steve likes BK301 course”<br> 

### Program:
% courses.pl

% Steve likes all easy courses
likes(steve, X) :- easy(X).

% Science courses are hard (included for completeness)
hard(X) :- science(X).

% All courses in "Have fun" dept are easy
easy(X) :- have_fun_course(X).

% BK301 is a "Have fun" department course
have_fun_course(bk301).


### Output:
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-06 094419" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86e8b808-e51c-45b6-bc88-f8ac313271bb" />


### Task 3:
Consider the statement <br> 
“This is a crime for an American to sell weapons to hostile nations. The Nano , enemy of America has some missiles and its missiles were sold it by Colonal West who is an American” <br> 
Convert to Clause form and prove west is criminal by using Prolog.<br> 
### Program:
% Rule: It's a crime for an American to sell weapons to hostile nations
criminal(X) :-
    american(X),
    weapon(Y),
    sells(X, Y, Z),
    hostile(Z).

% Facts
american(west).

enemy(nono, america).
hostile(nono).

missile(m1).
owns(nono, m1).

% All missiles are weapons
weapon(X) :- missile(X).

% Sales fact
sells(west, m1, nono).

### Output:
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-06 094644" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63690ffc-88c5-4936-9a4e-98afceae8c95" />


### Result:
Thus the prolog programs were executed successfully and the answer of query was found.
